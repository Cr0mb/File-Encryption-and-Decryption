# File-Encryption-and-Decryption
This Python script allows you to encrypt and decrypt a file using a password. The file is encrypted using the cryptography library, and the password is used to derive a cryptographic key using the PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 algorithm. The encrypted file is saved with a .locked extension, and a salt file is used to securely derive the key for decryption.
